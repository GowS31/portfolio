    <p>The following goes over work that I completed on my own time. </p>
    
    <h4><b>1. Map of Cemeteries in Peel Region</b></h4>
    <p>The following map showcases the location of various cemeteries that are located within the Peel Region (Ontario, Canada). The data was taken from the Region of Peel website and their Open Data Portal. Made use of ArcGIS Pro.</p>
    
    <h4><b>2. Brampton Facilities - Energy Consumption & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Web Map Application</b></h4>
    <p>I created a web map application (hosted on ArcGIS Online) based on the City of Brampton (Ontario, Canada) facilities and their annual GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, natural gas/energy consumption and more. This dataset (from Brampton's GeoHub website) has 711 records and includes city facilities such as public libraries, sports facilities, fire stations, transit buildings and administrative offices. Users can inspect the different sites and view relevant information pertaining to each site (address, year, total energy, etc.). They can also zoom in/out of different areas on the map, use the search feature, view the attribute table and more.I designed a basic arcade expression which assesses each facilities respective GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions and displays whether it is above or below 50,000 kg. The "IIf" function was used in this case and made use of the GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions field. A pie chart was created also to compare the Energy Intensity (ekWH/sq ft) and the GHG (greenhouse gas) Intensity (kg/sq ft) which is coded in red. In the attribute table below in the final column (gray arrow), the field for the arcade expression is displayed which shows some results as above or below according to the respective facility. Software/Languages: ArcGIS Pro, Online, WebApp Builder & Arcade</p>
    
    <h4><b>3. City of Toronto Coronavirus (COVID-19) Web Map Application</b></h4>
    <p>Created with ArcGIS Pro and hosted on ArcGIS Online, I created a web mapping application revolving the coronavirus (COVID-19) and related datasets within the city of Toronto (Ontario, Canada). This application has data layers including areas of neighbourhood improvement, locations of immunization clinics, testing site locations, public health service provider locations and the neighbourhood profile of Toronto (includes clipped data from an air pollution and COVID-19 impacts dataset in Toronto Neighbourhoods). Using ArcGIS WebApp Builder, the application has various widgets and users can zoom in and out of different areas, filter data and layers, select different areas for information and more. The data for this project was gathered from various open datasets such as the City of Toronto, Government of Canada, and the Ontario GeoHub website. Moreover, I played around with the Query widget in WebApp Builder where I created a basic query to find pharmacy locations in Toronto. An Arcade expression was also created based on the web map layer. A python script was created and used in ArcGIS Pro to list all the layers in the project and inspect for data source errors in each layer. Software/Languages: ArcGIS Pro, Online, WebApp Builder, Python/ArcPy & Arcade
    
    <h5> Arcade</h5>
    <p>The Arcade expression makes use of the male and female population data within the Neighbourhood Profile + Air Pollution and COVID-19 dataset. I created the variables "MAL" for male populations and "FEM" for female populations. The expression makes use of the logical function ("when") to evaluate records as either "high" if the male population is over 50 and "low" if the female population is less than 50. If the expressions both evaluate to not true, then it results in "n/a".</p>

    <h5> Python/ArcPy Code</h5>
    <p>With ArcGIS Pro and ArcPy, I developed the following python code to list all the current layers within this project and to check whether they have broken data sources. I made use of various ArcPy and Python features such as listLayers, listMaps, isBroken, for loops, arcpy.mp.ArcGISProject, print function and more. I first created a variable ("aprx") which references the current project. I then made use of the listMaps and listLayers methods to produce a list of all layers for each according map in the project. Following this, the for loops were used to iterate through each layer and print their names and associated isBroken layer property (checks for broken data source). The use of "\n" is done to input a line before the map name and form a separation between every layer for each map.GIS</p>
    
    <h4><b>4. Google Earth Engine Widget & Nitrogen Dioxide Concentration Levels</b></h4>
    <p>Based on a workshop, I developed a very simple Google Earth Engine widget using JavaScript code to compare nitrogen dioxide concentration levels in Toronto, Detroit, New York, and Chicago in 2019 and 2020. The data and information were taken from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) dataset which is a satellite instrument that produces near real-time high-resolution imagery of nitrogen dioxide and oxide concentration levels. Software/Languages: Google Earth Engine & JavaScript. The code used displays the differences between the nitrogen dioxide columns in Toronto, Detroit, New York and Chicago (and also a bit in Montreal) and shows that their concentration levels are noticeably less in 2020 compared to 2019. These differences can be a result of the various coronavirus lockdowns that occurred during those time periods.</p>
	  
    <h5> Code Breakdown</h5>
    <p>To create these resulting maps, the code had to developed a certain way with the first step being to import the TROPOMI nitrogen dioxide dataset, selected a product and then filter it for two separate timeframes. To display the various nitrogen dioxide concentration levels, I had to create a gradient of band color to represent them.The ui. functions are used to develop the widget and would now need to create two separate maps to display the information. Followed by this, both maps will have to be linked which will complete the widget and this is done with the ui.Map.Linker() function and setting the center of the map. The middle separator bar can work to compare the differences in nitrogen dioxide concentration levels between both timeframes.</p>
	  
    
    <h4><b>5. Cartographic Map of Zambia Hosptials & Airports</b></h4>
<p>This map displays the country of Zambia (Africa) and the locations of various hospitals, airports, country and provincial boundaries. The data was gathered from various websites and data portals. </p>
